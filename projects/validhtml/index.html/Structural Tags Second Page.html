        <p>"Metal music to me is a way of life. I love many kinds of music but there's something about the intesnsity and complexity of metal music that always has me banging my head and throwing up a pair of devil horns when I listen. I grew up on bands like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Disturbed, Killswitch Engage, and many other very well known metal acts. The influence that metal music has over a live audience is amazing to witness. People moshing, yelling the lyrics, and crowdsurfing were all elements of a really good live metal show. I have huge respect for all metal musicians because it is a very difficult genre of music to find major sucess in. I love the challange that brings, knowing that metal has been deemed as 'evil music' and 'just noise.' I really want change the mainstream population's idea of metal musicians that we're not all a bunch of satan loving, church burning bad guys. Metal music takes a lot of skill to perform with it being known to have techincal guitar playing, extremely fast drum playing, and having a wide range of vocals. I first picked up the guitar back in 2008 when I was 13. I wanted to be like my heavy metal idols as soon as possible so I worked really hard learning the basic fundamentals and some songs on guitar. I eventually came to realize that just playing covers of other's peoples work wasn't satisifying anymore so I sought out to be in a band of my own. I've been in previous before Cold Dead Hands but this is gonna be the band that I have the most fun with. I'm really looking forward to playing live shows in Orlando very soon!"</p>
