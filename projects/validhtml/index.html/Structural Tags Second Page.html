    <p>"Metal music to me, is a way of life. I love many kinds of music but there's something about the intesnsity and complexity of metal music that always has me banging my head and throwing up a pair of devil horns when I listen. I grew up on bands like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Disturbed, Killswitch Engage, and many other very well known metal acts. The influence that metal music has over a live audience is amazing to witness. People moshing, yelling the lyrics, and crowdsurfing were all elements of a really good live metal show. I have huge respect for all metal musicians because it is a very difficult genre of music to find major sucess in. I love the challange that brings, knowing that metal has been deemed as 'evil music' and 'just noise.' I really want change the mainstream population's idea of metal musicians that we're not all a bunch of stereotypical satan loving, church burning bad guys. I wanna break that stereotype and show people not familiar with the community that most of us are really nice guys. Metal music takes a lot of skill to perform with it being known to have techincal guitar playing, extremely fast drum playing, and having a wide range of vocals. I first picked up the guitar back in 2008 when I was 13. I wanted to be like my heavy metal idols as soon as possible so I worked really hard learning the basic fundamentals and some songs on guitar. I eventually came to realize that just playing covers of other's peoples work wasn't satisifying anymore so I sought out to be in a band of my own. I've been in previous before Cold Dead Hands but this is gonna be the band that I have the most fun with. I'm really looking forward to playing live shows in Orlando very soon!"</p>

    <p>Best friend of Josh Evans, Josh Rogers has been friends with Josh E. since early high school. They were both in a band about 6 years ago called 'Drowning In The Depths.' They eventually parted ways but reconvened and started working on a project called 'Cold Dead Hands.' Josh Rogers uses black metal and deathcore inspired vocal techinques in their song writing accompained by his extreme double bass drumming. "I've been in and out of bands since I was about 14 years old but this is my first vocal undertaking. Decided to hop on drums as well as vocals due to Florida's death metal drummer deficit. Ready to blast beat my way to Valhalla and arm wrestle Odin for title of 'toughest Viking bro' there ever was. Also, please be our drummer."</p>
